# Complex Disease Epigenetics Group Hackathon 2023: Team rejekkts



We have developed a juptyer notebook that plots isoform data. The figure provides a track of the selected isoform and a plot of the distribution of the count data grouped by developmental stage and sex. The user can select their isoform of choice and switch between isoforms by the drop down menu.
